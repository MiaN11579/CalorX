**Step 3:**

Go to the project root and execute the following command in the console to get the required dependencies: 

```
flutter pub get 
```
**Step 4:**

Setup the Firebase:

1. You'll need to create a Firebase instance. Follow the instructions at https://console.firebase.google.com.
2. Once your Firebase instance is created, you'll need to enable Google authentication.

* Go to the Firebase Console for your new instance.
* Click "Authentication" in the left-hand menu.
* Click the "sign-in method" tab.
* Click "Google" and enable it.

3. Enable the Firebase Database
* Go to the Firebase Console.
* Click "Database" in the left-hand menu.
* Click the Cloudstore "Create Database" button.
* Select "Start in test mode" and "Enable".

4. (skip if not running on Android)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for Android, with your app package name.
* Run the following command to get your SHA-1 key:

```
keytool -exportcert -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

* In the Firebase console, in the settings of your Android app, add your SHA-1 key by clicking "Add Fingerprint".
* Follow instructions to download google-services.json.
* Place `google-services.json` into `/android/app/`.

6. (skip if not running on iOS)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for iOS, with your app package name.
